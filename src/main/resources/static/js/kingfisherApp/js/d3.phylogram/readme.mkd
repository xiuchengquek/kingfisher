Demonstration of two common tree visualizations using [d3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3) and [newick.js](https://github.com/jasondavies/newick.js).  I hadn't found any examples of these kinds of right-angle trees so I figured I'd share.  Input data is a Newick-formatted guide tree from a clustalw multiple sequence alignment on some cytochrome b sequences from several North American snakes.  And it turns out the creator of newick.js also has an implementation of this kind of radial tree: check out [http://www.jasondavies.com/tree-of-life/](http://www.jasondavies.com/tree-of-life/)
