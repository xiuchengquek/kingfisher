# KingFisher

Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis and Visualization Tool


## Introduction

OncoBlocks is a new open-source project, initiated by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The goal of the project is to create reusable, open source software components to support cancer genomics research and enable precision (or "personalized") cancer medicine.

Project KingFisher a component of Oncoblock and is web-based prototype for visualizing and analyzing multiple genomic snapshots over time and space.

## Dependencies

1. SQL Database - Currently KingFisher is running on MySQL. Other dialects of SQL might work but have not been tested yet.
2. Java -  KingFisher have only been tested on Java 8.
3. Maven - KingFisher have only been tested on maven3 ( 3.3.3 to be specific)

By default, kingfisher will use the following environment variable for your database settings.

1. `$sql_address` - address of your mysql server. for eg. `localhost/kfisher`
2. `$sql_user` -  username for connecting to your MySQL server e.g. `kingfisheruser`
3. `$sql_pass` - password used to access the MySQL.
